# Visualizer
Amazing way to see how process of sorting happening by animation and changing color of blocks!

We have different Sorting Algorithms namely :
1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort
5. Selection sort

We can visualize the time taken by each algorithm for randomly generated block array number represented by height and analyze its efficiency.

Project used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4 and knowledge about different sorting algoritms.

thanks!!
